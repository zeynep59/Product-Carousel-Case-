User Story 
➔ Fetch the product list from this link sending a GET request. 
➔ Title of the carousel should be “Beğenebileceğinizi düşündüklerimiz” ➔ You code should only 
run in homepage, if user is on any other page you need to console.log “wrong page”. 
➔ When a user clicks on a product, the respective product page should open in a new tab. 
➔ If “price” and “original_price” are different, show both price like in the example and also 
calculate the discount amount and show it as well. 
➔ When user clicks on the heart icon should fill it with orange color, and this preference should 
be stored in the local storage in an array. 
➔ When the code runs for the second time: 
◆ It should retrieve the product list from local storage rather than sending a new fetch 
request. 
◆ Products marked as favorites before are displayed with filled heart icons. ➔ The 
design must be responsive and suitable for all platforms exactly like the website version.
